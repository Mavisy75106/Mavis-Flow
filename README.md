## Project Overview

**Mavis-Flow** is a lightweight automation tool I built to solve a personal pain point: a cluttered inbox. By leveraging advanced language models, it goes beyond simple rule-based filtering to understand the context and priority of your communications.

Stop managing your inbox; start focusing on your flow.

## Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Summarization**: Concise, context-aware summaries of long threads.
- **🏷️ Semantic Classification**: Automatically labels emails based on intent (Action Required, Informational, etc.).

- **🔒 Privacy-First**: Processes data securely with no third-party storage.
